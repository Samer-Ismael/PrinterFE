    <p><a href="index.html"> <-  Back to the Controller</a></p>

    <p>Welcome to the 3D Printer Control Panel, where you have complete control over your 3D printer's settings and operations.</p>

    <h2>Temperature Control</h2>
    <p>Adjust the temperature of the extruder and the heater bed to ensure optimal printing conditions. Fine-tune the settings to match the requirements of your filament and printing project.</p>

    <h2>File Upload</h2>
    <p>Upload a file for printing. Whether it's a model you've designed yourself or a pre-made template, simply select the file and initiate the printing process. You can also start or cancel a print job at any time, giving you full flexibility and control over your printing projects.</p>

    <h2>Controller</h2>
    <p>Manually control the printer's extruder to make precise adjustments to your printing process. Use the controller to move the extruder in the X, Y, and Z directions, ensuring accurate positioning and alignment for your prints.</p>

    <h2>Camera</h2>
    <p>Monitor your print job in real time with a live feed from your printer's camera. Watch as your design takes shape layer by layer, allowing you to spot any issues or errors as they occur and make adjustments accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Position Information</h2>
    <p>Check the current position of the extruder in the X, Y, and Z axes to ensure precise printing. Knowing the exact position of the extruder allows you to monitor the progress of your print job and make any necessary corrections or adjustments.</p>

    <h2>Fan Control</h2>
    <p>Control the speed of your printer's fan to regulate airflow and temperature during the printing process. Adjusting the fan speed can help improve print quality and reduce the risk of overheating or warping, ensuring successful prints every time.</p>
